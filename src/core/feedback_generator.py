# feedback_generator.py
"""
This module analyzes user activity and generates productivity insights.
It looks for patterns in the activity logs, identifies inefficiencies,
and suggests optimizations. It also serves as a recommendation engine
that the user can interact with in real-time.
"""

def analyze_user_activity(activity_log):
    """
    Analyzes the collected user activity data to find inefficiencies.
    
    - Logic: 
      1. Parse the activity log and group activities by type (e.g., app usage, file management, web browsing).
      2. Identify patterns (e.g., repetitive actions, frequent app switches).
      3. Detect potential bottlenecks (e.g., prolonged idle times, repeated errors).
      4. Generate insights such as "You are switching between apps frequently, consider using multi-window mode."
    
    - Program Interaction:
      This function interacts with the activity_monitor.py module by receiving its logs
      and processing the data. Insights will be passed to the task_scheduler.py module to trigger
      any potential task automation based on the analysis.
    
    - TODO-future:
      - Implement machine learning to improve pattern detection based on user history.
      - Add a feedback loop to allow the user to reject suggestions, improving relevance over time.

def generate_productivity_report(activity_log):
    """
    Generates a detailed productivity report based on user activity.
    
    - Logic:
      1. Summarize the activities performed by the user during a session.
      2. Provide metrics such as time spent per app, number of tasks completed, etc.
      3. Include recommendations for improving productivity (e.g., "Try using X app to streamline Y process").
    
    - Program Interaction:
      Works in tandem with analyze_user_activity() to provide meaningful insights 
      directly to the user. The report may trigger alerts or be sent as a message 
      for the user to review via the GUI automation system.
    
    - TODO-future:
      - Integrate with a dashboard UI for real-time viewing of reports.
      - Add options to automatically trigger task automations based on certain recommendations.

def provide_real_time_insight(activity_snapshot):

    Provides real-time feedback based on a snapshot of user activity.
    
    - Logic:
      1. Monitor user activity in real-time and compare it with historical data.
      2. Suggest immediate tips to improve current workflows (e.g., "You’ve been on the same screen for 10 minutes; do you need help?").
    
    - Program Interaction:
      Uses data directly from the activity_monitor.py module for real-time feedback.
      This function communicates directly with the task_scheduler to trigger automation 
      if a user agrees to act on the suggestions.
    
    - TODO-future:
      - Refine the feedback algorithm to make it context-aware (e.g., different suggestions for work-related vs leisure activities).

"""
FeedbackGenerator is responsible for analyzing user activity data, generating insights, 
and providing productivity tips or automation recommendations. This module is designed 
to adapt over time based on the user's behavior.

The system should be able to:
1. Analyze activity patterns (e.g., repetitive tasks, frequent app usage)
2. Provide suggestions for automation based on observed patterns
3. Suggest productivity improvements (e.g., frequent task bottlenecks)

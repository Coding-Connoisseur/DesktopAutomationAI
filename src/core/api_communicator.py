# api_communicator.py
"""
This module manages communication between the AI and external APIs, particularly the ChatGPT-4 API.
It sends queries to the ChatGPT-4 API for task assistance, processes responses,
and integrates the suggested actions into the broader automation workflow.

      1. Accept a query string (representing a task the AI is struggling to complete).

      This function is called whenever the AI encounters a task that it cannot solve on its own.
      The result is passed back to the task_executor.py module to continue the task automation.

      - Improve query format to provide context and detailed information to the API for better responses.
      - Cache frequent responses to reduce API calls and improve speed.

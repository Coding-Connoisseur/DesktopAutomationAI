task_scheduler.py

This module is responsible for scheduling and managing task execution. It maintains a queue of tasks and ensures that tasks are executed in an efficient manner, accounting for retries in case of failure.

        - It can interact with error_handler if a task fails and needs to be re-queued.

        - Implemented a basic scheduling algorithm.

        - This function executes tasks using task_executor and monitors their completion.
        - If a task fails, it calls error_handler to log the error and determine the next steps.

    - Capture all user keystrokes using an OS-specific API (e.g., pynput or pyobjc).

    How it interacts with the program:
    - This function feeds real-time data to the `feedback_generator.py` module for analysis and advice generation.

    - Implement a listener for specific hotkeys or shortcut patterns.

    Logic:
    - Track the currently active application using system APIs like psutil.
    - Log the duration the user spends on each application and switch between apps.
    
    How it interacts with the program:
    - Provides input for the analysis engine to offer productivity tips, such as suggesting time management improvements.
    
    TODO-future tasks:
    - Add the ability to detect specific app usage patterns (e.g., frequently toggling between certain apps).
    - Implement alerting mechanisms for extended use of distracting apps.

    - Data is used to generate reports on productivity and propose improvements like site blocking or time caps.

    - Implement browser-agnostic functionality using Selenium or Puppeteer to track activity across all browsers.
    - Add incognito mode detection and reporting.

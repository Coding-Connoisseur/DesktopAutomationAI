# window_manager.py
# This module manages interactions with windows (open, close, resize, move) in the GUI.
# It interacts with the GUI automation core to ensure correct window management for task execution.

import pyautogui  # Assuming usage of pyautogui for window control, may change to other libraries if necessary

def open_window(window_name):
    """
    Opens a window by name or application.
    
    Logic:
    - Use OS-specific methods or libraries (e.g., pyautogui or psutil) to open the desired window.
    - The window name is passed as an argument, and the function will either search for an existing instance
      or launch the program if not running.
    - The opened window should be brought into focus after opening.

    Interaction:
    - This function is called by the task_executor when the user requests to open a specific application or window.
    - It also interacts with task_triggers.py when a specific window-based event occurs (e.g., a window needs to be opened for automation).
    
    TODO:
    - Implement OS-specific window launching logic (Windows, macOS, Linux).
    - Add error handling for cases where the window cannot be found or fails to open.
    - Consider allowing interaction with the program if it’s already running rather than launching a new instance.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for logic

def close_window(window_name):
    """
    Closes a window by name or application.

    Logic:
    - Find the target window and send a command to close it (either via OS-level commands or using a window management library).
    - Ensure the application is closed gracefully, handling any pop-ups or unsaved data warnings.

    Interaction:
    - Called by task_executor.py when a task requires the closure of a specific window.
    - Interacts with self_learning.py if repeated attempts to close a window fail (self-healing required).
    
    TODO:
    - Add support for gracefully closing applications with unsaved work.
    - Implement a method for confirming window closure and retry if unsuccessful.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for logic

def resize_window(window_name, width, height):
    """
    Resizes a specified window to given dimensions.

    Logic:
    - Identify the window by its name and change its size to the specified width and height.
    - This may involve detecting the current size of the window and adjusting incrementally.
    - Ensure the resized window stays on the screen and is usable (no part of it is off-screen).

    Interaction:
    - Used by other automation modules that require the window to be a specific size for task automation (e.g., browser automation).
    - Interacts with task_scheduler.py when there’s a need to schedule resizing in a series of tasks.
    
    TODO:
    - Implement logic to ensure the window doesn’t go off-screen during resizing.
    - Add error handling to revert to original size if resizing fails.
    - Check for resolution compatibility and adjust size accordingly.
    """
    pass  # Placeholder for logic

def move_window(window_name, x, y):
    """
    Moves a window to specified coordinates on the screen.

    Logic:
    - Locate the window using the provided name and move it to the (x, y) coordinates.
    - Ensure that the entire window remains visible on-screen after moving.

    Interaction:
    - This function can be triggered when task automation requires specific window arrangements (e.g., two windows side-by-side).
    - Interacts with gui_control.py to ensure the user can still interact with the window after moving.
    
    TODO:
    - Implement edge detection logic to prevent windows from being moved off-screen.
    - Add compatibility for multi-monitor setups.
    """

# task_triggers.py

def detect_button_click(button_image_path):
    """
    Detects when a specific button is clicked by the user.

    Logic:
    - Use image recognition to locate the button on the screen.
    - Once the button is clicked, trigger a predefined automation task or sequence.
    - This function can continuously monitor the screen until the button is pressed, or it can be used reactively.
    
    Interaction:
    - Interacts with task_executor.py to start specific tasks once the button click is detected.
    - May interact with self_learning.py to modify or improve the detection based on historical success rates.
    
    TODO:
    - Implement continuous screen monitoring to detect the buttonâ€™s presence.
    - Add flexibility for dynamic button locations and resolution changes.
    - Integrate with error_handler.py to retry the task if the button is not found or clicked correctly.

def trigger_task_on_window_open(window_name, task_function):
    """
    Triggers a task when a specific window is opened.

    Logic:
    - Monitor system processes or open window list for the appearance of a specified window.
    - Once the window is detected, automatically trigger the provided task function (e.g., form filling or interaction).
    - This function can be useful when certain automations need to happen when a particular application is opened.

    Interaction:
    - Directly interacts with window_manager.py to monitor window opening.
    - Calls task_executor.py to perform the associated task once the window is detected.
    
    TODO:
    - Add robust monitoring for all operating systems to detect window openings.
    - Implement logic to avoid triggering the task multiple times for the same window.

def schedule_task_on_button_click(button_image_path, task_function):
    """
    Schedules a task to be executed after detecting a button click.

    Logic:
    - Similar to `detect_button_click`, but also includes scheduling logic to execute the task after the button click event.
    - Allows tasks to be queued and performed in sequence or after a delay once a user-triggered event (button click) happens.

    Interaction:
    - Interacts with task_scheduler.py to schedule the task after detecting the button click.
    - Works closely with task_executor.py to ensure the task is executed properly.
    
    TODO:
    - Add support for queuing tasks and providing feedback when tasks are scheduled after an event.
    - Consider adding delay options (e.g., trigger the task after 5 seconds of button click detection).

# learning_agent.py - Reinforcement learning agent that tracks successful and failed tasks

class LearningAgent:

        Initializes the LearningAgent class.
        
        Logic:
        1) Tracks task outcomes (successes and failures) and adjusts the retry strategy based on past performance.
        2) Uses reinforcement learning principles to improve task execution over time.
        
        Interaction with the program:
        - The LearningAgent is connected to the core task execution system, where it monitors each task.
        - Based on the results, it updates the retry strategies to increase efficiency and success rates.

        - Future task: Implement a basic reinforcement learning model that can adjust strategies dynamically.

        Starts monitoring task executions and their outcomes.
        
        Logic:
        1) Record every task attempt, along with the result (success/failure).
        2) Analyze patterns to suggest optimizations (e.g., retry immediately for certain tasks, skip retries for others).
        
        Interaction with the program:
        - This function is called when task execution begins. It continuously monitors tasks and tracks their outcomes.

        - Future task: Add logic to store data in a persistent format (e.g., saving to a database or file) for long-term learning.

        Records the outcome of a task (success or failure) and updates the learning model.

        1) Log the task's outcome along with relevant details (e.g., how many retries were attempted, time taken).
        2) If the task failed, update the retry strategy to try a different approach next time.
        
        Interaction with the program:
        - This method is called every time a task completes, either successfully or after failure.
        - The data collected here informs future retries and optimizations.

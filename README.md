# AI Desktop and Browser Automation Tool

## Overview

This project is a modular and scalable AI-powered desktop and browser automation tool. The AI constantly monitors the user’s activity on the computer, provides insights, automates advanced tasks, and interacts with the OpenAI ChatGPT-4 API to solve complex tasks autonomously. The system is designed to be self-healing, self-learning, and fully autonomous, continually improving based on its experiences and task outcomes.

## Features

- **Activity Monitoring**: Tracks user activity on the desktop and browser (keystrokes, apps used, websites visited) to understand patterns.
- **Task Automation**: Automates a variety of tasks such as file management, window control, form filling, and browser navigation.
- **Self-Healing**: Detects task failures and retries with alternative methods until success is achieved.
- **Self-Learning**: Continuously learns from successful and failed tasks to improve future performance.
- **ChatGPT-4 Integration**: Collaborates with OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4 to request help for tasks that require higher-level guidance or instructions.
- **Insightful Feedback**: Analyzes user activity and provides recommendations for improving productivity or automating repetitive tasks.

## Architecture

The project is structured into core modules that handle the AI’s main functionality, and auxiliary modules that provide utilities such as error handling, logging, and configuration management.
